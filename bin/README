Ludwig has been tested and compiled on both linux and macOS systems. In the /bin directory
there will be two binaries present, one is compiled for linux, the other for macOS. These binaries
may be some number of versions out of date. Therefore, if it is impossible, it is better to compile
a fresh binary either using the './build' script or the './install' script. Both scripts compile a fresh
binary, and the './install' script installs said binary to the /usr/bin.

IF you are on windows, you may attempt to compile and test it. If you find any bugs, feel free to shoot me
an email at <77ylnts@gmail.com>. I am, however, only able to maintain binaries for macOS and for linux.
